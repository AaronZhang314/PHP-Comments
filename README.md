# PHP Comment Section
Learning a basic comment section made in PHP.

## Current Features
1. Must be logged in to comment (login passwords will be made so that only students in the class can comment)
2. Able to comment, edit or delete posts


## Ideas (to be added later)
* Somehow going to incorporate into my Coding Buddies website
  * Maybe host it somewhere else and link an api to access
  * Or just host website not on github (because github only supports static websites)
